**Goal:** Confirm all core components of your Edge Kit (Jetson, RealSense, ReSpeaker) are functional and can collect basic data.

#### Steps:

1.  **Jetson Orin Nano Setup (Basics):
    *   **Flash Ubuntu:** Follow the official [NVIDIA Jetson Getting Started Guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-orin-nano-devkit) to flash the latest JetPack OS (which includes Ubuntu, CUDA, cuDNN, etc.) onto your 128GB MicroSD card.
    *   **Initial Boot & Configuration:** Boot up your Jetson, complete the initial setup (user, password, network), and ensure it can connect to the internet.
2.  **Intel RealSense D435i Integration (Practical):
    *   **Install librealsense SDK:** Connect your RealSense D435i to a USB 3.0 port on the Jetson. Follow the [librealsense GitHub installation instructions](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md) for Ubuntu on ARM (Jetson).
    *   **Test with `realsense-viewer`:** Once installed, run `realsense-viewer` from the terminal (`realsense-viewer`). Verify that you can see RGB and Depth streams in real-time. Experiment with different camera settings.
    *   **Basic Python Script (Example Code):**
        ```python
        import pyrealsense2 as rs
        import numpy as np
        import cv2

        try:
            pipeline = rs.pipeline()
            config = rs.config()
            config.enable_stream(rs.stream.depth, 640, 480, rs.format.z16, 30)
            config.enable_stream(rs.stream.color, 640, 480, rs.format.bgr8, 30)

            pipeline.start(config)

            print("RealSense streams started. Press 'q' to quit.")

            while True:
                frames = pipeline.wait_for_frames()
                depth_frame = frames.get_depth_frame()
                color_frame = frames.get_color_frame()

                if not depth_frame or not color_frame:
                    continue

                depth_image = np.asanyarray(depth_frame.get_data())
                color_image = np.asanyarray(color_frame.get_data())

                depth_colormap = cv2.applyColorMap(cv2.convertScaleAbs(depth_image, alpha=0.03), cv2.COLORMAP_JET)

                images = np.hstack((color_image, depth_colormap))

                cv2.namedWindow('RealSense Streams', cv2.WINDOW_AUTOSIZE)
                cv2.imshow('RealSense Streams', images)

                if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
                    break

            cv2.destroyAllWindows()
            pipeline.stop()

        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
        ```
        *   Save this as `realsense_test.py` on your Jetson and run it with `python3 realsense_test.py`.
3.  **ReSpeaker USB Mic Array v2.0 Test (Practical):
    *   **Connect & Verify:** Connect your ReSpeaker to a USB port on the Jetson. Open a terminal and run `arecord -l` to list available recording devices. Look for your ReSpeaker device (e.g., `card 1: seeed2micvoice [seeed-2mic-voicecard]`).
    *   **Basic Audio Recording (Example Command):**
        ```bash
        arecord -D plughw:1,0 -f S16_LE -r 16000 -d 5 test_audio.wav
        ```
        *   Replace `plughw:1,0` with your ReSpeaker's card and device number if different. This command records 5 seconds of audio to `test_audio.wav`. Play it back with `aplay test_audio.wav` to confirm it works.
4.  **Data Logging (Advanced Practice):
    *   Extend your Python script for the RealSense camera to save short video clips (RGB and depth) and corresponding audio files using the `cv2.VideoWriter` for video and the `soundfile` or `wave` library for audio.
    *   This step validates that you can reliably capture and store multimodal sensor data, a prerequisite for training and deploying more advanced AI models.

This foundational project ensures that all critical hardware components of your Physical AI Edge Kit are functioning as expected, setting the stage for deeper dives into ROS 2, AI model deployment, and real-world robot interaction.
